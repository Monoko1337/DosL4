# Layer4 L4 DDoS (UDP-RAW-TCP-SYN)
- This category includes all those attacks that, for example, use malformed packets (tcp, syn and ack).
- Further down the protocol stack, these tools use protocols such as UDP to send large volumes of traffic to a designated server, such as during a UDP flood event.
- While often ineffective individually, these attacks typically take the form of DDoS attacks where the effect is enhanced by additional attacking machines.
